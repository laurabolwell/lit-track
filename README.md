# LIT TRACK

LitTrack is a digital reading record for young children to record their learning to read journey.
Parents can log reading sessions they have completed at home, and they can view all reading sessions completed both at home and in school for all their children in one place.
Teachers can log sessions, view all sessions of all the children in their class, they can update reading levels for the whole class from one page and can update the teacher of the students in the same way. 
It is quick and easy to use for all users. 

The website is designed to be fully responsive, allowing visitors to view it on a wide range of devices.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/colour-palette.png)

- `#673C66` used for card panels on login/register pages and modals.
- `#A661A7` used for buttons.
- `#ADD982` used for card panels throughout site.
- `#CCE7B1` used for student individual card panels.
- `#48BDE8` used for the navbar and footer.
- `#90DDF8` used for flash messages.

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --plum: #673C66;
    --celadon: #CCE7B1;
    --pistachio: #ADD982;
    --sky-blue: #90DDF8;
    --aero: #48BDE8;
    --dark-mauve: #A661A7;
    /* Overriding standard materialize colours */
    --primary-color: var(--plum);
    --font-color-main: var(--plum);
    --font-color-medium: var(--plum);
    --font-color-disabled: var(--aero);
}
```

### Typography

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site.

### Future Features

- Admin User
    - In the future an admin user would be useful to oversee all users and to be able to move students between teachers, as well as deleting unused accounts.
- Teachers to be able to add students
    - It would be useful if teachers could also add students to the site, but would require a registration code to be given to the parents so that their children and all information already held in the database could be linked to their account. This is something that I will look at adding in the future.

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **lit_track**.

It contains 3 collections:

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | user_type | String | |
    | title | String | |
    | fname | String | |
    | lname | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

- **students**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | fname | String | |
    | lname | String | |
    | reading_level | String | |
    | teacher | ObjectId() | _id from user collection |
    | parent | ObjectId() | _id from user collection |

- **reading_sessions***
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | student | ObjectId() | _id from student collection |
    | date | String | formatted for displaying on app |
    | title | String | |
    | book_level | String | |
    | comment | String | |
    | logged_by | ObjectId() | _id from user collection |
    | date_sort | String | formatted for sorting |

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment


The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://lit-track-313aa42e46f6.herokuapp.com).

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:
- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **Lit_track**.
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be **users**, **students**, and **reading_sessions**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/laurabolwell/lit-track) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git shell or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/laurabolwell/lit-track.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/laurabolwell/lit-track)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

#### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/laurabolwell/lit-track)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!

### Local VS Deployment

There are no known differences between the local development version and the live deployed site on Heroku.
