# LIT TRACK

LitTrack is a digital reading record for young children to record their learning to read journey.
Parents can log reading sessions they have completed at home, and they can view all reading sessions completed both at home and in school for all their children in one place.
Teachers can log sessions, view all sessions of all the children in their class, they can update reading levels for the whole class from one page and can update the teacher of the students in the same way. 
It is quick and easy to use for all users. 

The website is designed to be fully responsive, allowing visitors to view it on a wide range of devices.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

![screenshot](documentation/colour-palette.png)

- `#673C66` used for card panels on login/register pages and modals.
- `#A661A7` used for buttons.
- `#ADD982` used for card panels throughout site.
- `#CCE7B1` used for student individual card panels.
- `#48BDE8` used for the navbar and footer.
- `#90DDF8` used for flash messages.

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    --plum: #673C66;
    --celadon: #CCE7B1;
    --pistachio: #ADD982;
    --sky-blue: #90DDF8;
    --aero: #48BDE8;
    --dark-mauve: #A661A7;
    /* Overriding standard materialize colours */
    --primary-color: var(--plum);
    --font-color-main: var(--plum);
    --font-color-medium: var(--plum);
    --font-color-disabled: var(--aero);
}
```

### Typography

⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️

## Database Design

My project uses a non-relational database with MongoDB, and therefore the database architecture
doesn't have actual relationships like a relational database would.

My database is called **task_manager**.

It contains 3 collections:

- **categories**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | category_name | String | |

- **tasks**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | category_name | String | selected from *categories* collection |
    | task_name | String | |
    | task_description | String | |
    | is_urgent | String | |
    | due_date | String | |
    | created_by | String | selected from the *users* collection |

- **users**
    | Key | Type | Notes |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | _id | ObjectId() | |
    | username | String | |
    | password | String | uses Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA) |

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://lit-track-313aa42e46f6.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Relational Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: PLACEHOLDER-NAME).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### MongoDB Non-Relational Database

This project uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) for the Non-Relational Database.

To obtain your own MongoDB Database URI, sign-up on their site, then follow these steps:
- The name of the database on MongoDB should be called **insert-your-database-name-here**.
- The collection(s) needed for this database should be **insert-your-collection-names-here**.
- Click on the **Cluster** name created for the project.
- Click on the **Connect** button.
- Click **Connect Your Application**.
- Copy the connection string, and replace `password` with your own password (also remove the angle-brackets).

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `IP` | 0.0.0.0 |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | user's own value |
| `MONGO_URI` | user's own value |
| `PORT` | 5000 |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`
- *replace **app.py** with the name of your primary Flask app name; the one at the root-level*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

If you are using SQLAlchemy for your project, you need to create a local PostgreSQL database.
In this example, the example database name is **db-name**.

```shell
workspace (branch) $ set_pg
workspace (branch) $ psql

... connection to postgres ...

postgres=# CREATE DATABASE db-name;
CREATE DATABASE
postgres=# \c db-name;
You are now connected to database "db-name" as user "foobar".
db-name=# \q
```

Once that database is created, you must migrate the database changes from your models.py file.
This example uses **app-name** for the name of the primary Flask application.

```shell
workspace (branch) $ python3

... connection to Python CLI ...

>>> from app-name import db
>>> db.create_all()
>>> exit()
```

To confirm that the database table(s) have been created, you can use the following:

```shell
workspace (branch) $ psql -d db-name

... connection to postgres ...

postgres=# \dt

	List of relations
Schema | Name | Type | Owner
-------+------+------+--------
public | blah1 | table | foobar
public | blah2 | table | foobar
public | blah3 | table | foobar

db-name=# \q
```

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps, plus a few extras.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DB_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
os.environ.setdefault("DEVELOPMENT", "True")
```

If using Flask-Migrate, make sure to include the following steps as well.

During the course of development, it became necessary to update the PostgreSQL data models.
In order to do this, [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io) was used.

- `pip3 install Flask-Migrate`
- Import the newly installed package on your main `__init__.py` file:
	- `from flask_migrate import Migrate`
- Define **Migrate** in the same file after **app** and **db** are defined:
	- `migrate = Migrate(app, db)`
- Initiate the migration changes in the terminal:

```shell
workspace (branch) $ flask db init

	... generating migrations ...

workspace (branch) $ set_pg
workspace (branch) $ flask db migrate -m "Add a commit message for this migration"

	... migrating changes ...

workspace (branch) $ flask db upgrade

	... updating database ...
```
